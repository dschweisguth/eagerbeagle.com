  <h1>Heartspring</h1>
  <p>At a former public restroom northeast of the intersection of Gilman, Hunter's Point Expressway and Donahue. Some security guards drove all the way over here from the road to see what we were doing. Turns out we were having a refreshing drink. Be careful if you go here, however: the drain is full of ants.</p>
