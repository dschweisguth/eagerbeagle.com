  <br><br><b>Happy birthday!</b>
  <br><br>Huxley turned two on June 25th. A bunch of friends (human and dog) came over for beer and Penny's homemade sausage on our new grill. Hux didn't get any sausage, but he did get several very nice presents. His favorite is this plush cake, which plays a tinny &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; when bitten. Huxley likes to set it off, howl along 'til it stops, and do it again. And again, and again, and again.
