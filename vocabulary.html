      <h1>Huxley Beagle's Vocabulary</h1>
    </div>
    <h2>Basic commands</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Sit (***)</dt>
      <dd>Huxley sits at every light. He's walked to work hundreds of
        times and all over the city, so he's had plenty of practice.</dd>
      <dt>Down (***)</dt>
      <dd>Lie down. Gesture: point to the floor or tap on it in front of
        him.</dd>
      <dt>Sit up (***)</dt>
      <dd>Go from lying down to sitting up. We first tried using "sit"
        for this, but that never worked at all. Once we made up a 'new'
        command Hux picked it up right away.</dd>
      <dt>Stand up (**)</dt>
      <dd>Go from lying or sitting to standing up.</dd>
      <dt>Stay (**)</dt>
      <dd>Will stay for a minute, but not for many minutes. Gesture:
        open-handed stop sign.</dd>
      <dt>Come here (**)</dt>
      <dd>Gesture: kneel down and/or stare fixedly at him. For extra
        emphasis, whistle high-low in the same tones as the verbal
        command.</dd>
      <dt>OK (***)</dt>
      <dd>Release from "stay", "wait", "play dead", etc.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Advanced commands</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Back to bed (*)</dt>
      <dd>Go to his dog bed. Only works when we're both next to it.</dd>
      <dt>Find Dave, Find Penny (***)</dt>
      <dd>Go where the other one of us is. Gesture: Point towards the
        person he should find, or the direction he should go to find
        them.</dd>
      <dt>Ready? (***)</dt>
      <dd>Pay attention because I'm about to throw something for you to
        fetch or catch.</dd>
      <dt>Get it (***)</dt>
      <dd>Fetch. Once we found the first toy he liked enough to chase,
        Hux turned into a great fetcher!</dd>
      <dt>Up (***)</dt>
      <dd>Jump up onto a ledge. Hux can jump 36 inches straight up on to
        Dave's desk.</dd>
      <dt>Jump in (no stars)</dt>
      <dd>Get into his dog carrier. This one has never had a hope of
        succeeding, as not only is there nothing he likes less than his
        dog carrier, he's outgrown it.</dd>
      <dt>Jump up (**)</dt>
      <dd>Jump up in to the back seat of the car. We're not sure why he
        usually hesitates and even whines when asked to do this, but he
        does it eventually. There's no good reason why this is different
        from "Up", but it is.</dd>
      <dt>Look (*)</dt>
      <dd>Look at me so I can take your picture, or so that you'll see
        where I throw the ball.</dd>
      <dt>Excuse me (**)</dt>
      <dd>Move so that I can go where you are now.</dd>
      <dt>Look out (*)</dt>
      <dd>Move, because you're in the way or in danger of something.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Walking around</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Let's go (**)</dt>
      <dd>Follow me; we're going out. It only just occurred to me that
        we say this consistently and Hux responds to it consistently. I
        wonder if he thinks it's a command or whether he's just always
        ready to go?</dd>
      <dt>Leave it (**)</dt>
      <dd>Don't pick that up!</dd>
      <dt>Drop it (**)</dt>
      <dd>Now that you've picked it up anyway, drop it! Better late than
        never.</dd>
      <dt>Easy (no stars)</dt>
      <dd>Stop pulling on the leash.</dd>
      <dt>Wait (**)</dt>
      <dd>Stand still and wait for the human holding the leash to catch
        up. Used when walking on a long leash and about to pass
        something potentially dangerous like an intersection or a garage
        door.</dd>
      <dt>Around (***)</dt>
      <dd>Go around a tree or pole to untangle his leash. Huxley seems
        to be proud of having figured this one out; he prances proudly
        when he does it.</dd>
      <dt>Sidewalk (**)</dt>
      <dd>As in "get out of the street and back on the sidewalk".</dd>
      <dt>Traffic (no stars)</dt>
      <dd>Get out of the way of other people on the sidewalk. Used when
        walking on a long leash. Occasional apparent successes are
        probably due to Hux's increasing experience on the leash rather
        than to his having learned the command.</dd>
      <dt>This way (**)</dt>
      <dd>Stop going the other way and follow me.</dd>
      <dt>Come on (**)</dt>
      <dd>Stop sniffing around and follow me. Whether this one works or
        not depends on what he's sniffing.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Tricks</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Up (**)</dt>
      <dd>This means "stand on your hind legs to reach a treat in my
        hand", too. Always successful despite the ambiguity, given the
        promise of the treat.</dd>
      <dt>Beg (**)</dt>
      <dd>Sit up on your hind legs. Only differs from "up" in that the
        treat is closer to the ground.</dd>
      <dt>Pets (**)</dt>
      <dd>Stand on his hind legs and put his paws on your knees so you
        can reach his head for some petting. Gesture: slap your knees.</dd>
      <dt>Shake hands (***)</dt>
      <dd>Hux learned this one fast! He actually seems to be learning
        how to learn. Gesture: offer your hand.</dd>
      <dt>Right paw (* 1/2)</dt>
      <dd>Shake with his right paw instead of his left. (Oops; we should
        have taught him to use his right paw in the first place.) Huxley
        hasn't figured out left and right yet, so he always offers his
        paw, but it's only the correct one 50% of the time.<br>
      </dd>
      <dt>High five (***)</dt>
      <dd>Put up his paw for a high five. Gesture: do it yourself.</dd>
      <dt>Play dead (**)</dt>
      <dd>Roll onto his back. Gesture: Move hand, preferably with a
        treat, over his head to one side.</dd>
      <dt>Roll over (**)</dt>
      <dd>Roll onto his back, keep going, and wind up on all fours
        again. Hux can't really tell this from "play dead" (we've really
        been pouring on the tricks lately) but if the hand with the
        treat keeps going, so does Hux.</dd>
      <dt>Go on lookout (***)</dt>
      <dd>Climb halfway up the stairs and stick his head through the
        railing. We taught Huxley this in memory of his late lamented
        cousin Milo. Gesture: Wave your hand to shoo him up the stairs.</dd>
      <dt>Howl (**)</dt>
      <dd>Huxley resists howling on command. Sometimes he just makes a
        little noise to see if it's enough. He's less willing to do it
        in public than at home. He seems to think it's inappropriate,
        like swearing. Gesture: Blow a little air in his face.</dd>
      <dt>Alley-oop! (**)</dt>
      <dd>Jump through Penny's arms held in a circle.</dd>
      <dt>Go long! (**)</dt>
      <dd>Move farther away so I can lob his ball at him so he can catch
        it. Gesture: pretend to toss the ball.</dd>
      <dt>Spin! (*)</dt>
      <dd>Turn around in a tight circle. Gesture: move a treat in a tight circle around Huxley's head.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Good boy! [chirpy] (***)</dt>
      <dd>Looks up to see if he's been good enough for a treat. If that
        doesn't get his attention, "very good!" surely will.</dd>
      <dt>Ohhhhhh! [long falling tone] (**)</dt>
      <dd>Hux, you gave the wrong response to a command! </dd>
      <dt>Off! (***)</dt>
      <dd>As in "get your front paws off that person" or the kitchen
        counter, or "get off the sofa".</dd>
      <dt>Quiet! (no stars)</dt>
      <dd>Said in a low growly tone of voice, just like an irritated
        older dog. Despite the verisimilitude, Hux shows no sign of
        having gotten this one.</dd>
      <dt>No! (***)</dt>
      <dd>Gets it every time, probably due to the tone of voice it's
        said in.</dd>
      <dt>Bad dog! (***)</dt>
      <dd>The words don't matter much; when we say this (which we almost
        never have to), Hux gets the point from our angry voice.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Ratings</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>No stars</dt>
      <dd>Huxley doesn't know this command. Only his owners do.</dd>
      <dt>*</dt>
      <dd>Still in training.</dd>
      <dt>**</dt>
      <dd>Usually gets it. Might need repetition, hand or body signals
        or a leash-tug in the right direction. Might blow it if there's
        distraction.</dd>
      <dt>***</dt>
      <dd>Gets it every time.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Huxley always responds best to a command when it's preceded by
      his name, and when it's pronounced clearly and in the tones he's
      used to. Every command has its correct tone, describing which
      correctly would really take some effort. Sometimes the tone
      conveys emotion; sometimes it mimics the desired motion. Many
      commands have gestures, to which Hux pays at least as much
      attention as the verbal equivalents.</p>
