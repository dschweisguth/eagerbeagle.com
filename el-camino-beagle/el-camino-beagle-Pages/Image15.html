  <br><br><b>Firestone</b>
  <br><br>Our last taste on Sunday was at Firestone, where picture windows frame a spectacular view of Foxen Canyon. This wasn't the winery where that guy from &quot;Sideways&quot; drank from the dump bucket, but we thought at the time it was, and wondered whether that's why the buckets they have there now are built one-way so you can't drink from them.
