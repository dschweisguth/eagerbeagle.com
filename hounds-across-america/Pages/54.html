  <h1>Camel Butte and The Thumb</h1>
  <p>At the entrance to the tribal park the guard, a sunburned old woman, had warned us that the tribe had had to haul several cars like mine out of the valley. I promised to drive carefully. I only made it this far, to the beginning of the loop, before I figured the car had had enough for one day.</p>
