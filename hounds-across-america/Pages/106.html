  <h1>Jefferson Davis Presidential Library</h1>
  <p>Beauvoir, the estate where Jefferson Davis lived his last years, is off to the left. (It is more picturesque than the library but less well sited for a photo with beagles.)

The flag was Mississippi's state flag until 2021, when it was replaced by a flag with a magnolia blossom. It still flies proudly over many properties in rural Mississippi.</p>
