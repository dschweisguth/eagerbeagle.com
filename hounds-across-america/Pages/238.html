  <h1>Post rock country</h1>
  <p>North central Kansas has so few trees that its settlers used rock for fenceposts. Corner posts are braced by two diagonals.

Once one notices Kansas limestone, it's everywhere: the Garden of Eden is built of it, as are historic buildings in Wilson and Dodge City (coming up) and the Stonehenge-esque signs that welcomed us to several towns including Lebanon.</p>
