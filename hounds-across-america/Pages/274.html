  <h1>Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas</h1>
  <p>We'd been taking pictures in front of signs and such for the whole trip, but not until Las Vegas did we feel that we were on trend. This sign has its own parking lot! While we were there more than one group arrived who had come a very long way or by some strenuous means. There was even a group of Central American women in traditional costume.</p>
