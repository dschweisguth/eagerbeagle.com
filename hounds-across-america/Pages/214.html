  <h1>At the base of the Gateway Arch</h1>
  <p>This was the worst day of the trip for the dogs. Beagles hate water, and we got caught in the rain. They don't care that they're inside an outstanding civil engineering achievement.

We slogged our way back to the hotel, dried them off with hair driers (flipping a breaker in the process) and they were back to their bouncy selves.</p>
