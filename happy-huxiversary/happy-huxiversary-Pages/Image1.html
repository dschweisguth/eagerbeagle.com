  <br><br><b>Doggie Diner heads</b>
  <br><br>Maybe you remember a similar head, on a pole, from the pictures we sent around on Hux's birthday. Here's someone's entire collection parked in the Mission flea market lot. Just to the left was a collection of parts for an enormous Mousetrap game, sized for bowling balls instead of ball bearings.
