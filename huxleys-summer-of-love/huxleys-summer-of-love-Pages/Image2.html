  <br><br><b>Faultline</b>
  <br><br>It's not Huxley's fault. The crack in Andy Goldsworthy's &quot;Drawn Stone&quot; (renamed from &quot;Faultline&quot; after someone got cold feet about admitting that this is earthquake country) runs through the stones of the pavement and each boulder.

After I took this picture and Huxley hopped down from his pedestal, a group of well-dressed Japanese tourists who had been waiting behind us applauded and complimented him on his good behavior.
