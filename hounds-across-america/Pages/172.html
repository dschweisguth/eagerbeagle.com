  <h1>Cocaine bear</h1>
  <p>The recent film was inspired by this unfortunate bear, killed by eating 75 pounds of cocaine dropped from a smugglers' plane in the woods near Knoxville, TN. It is now on display in the "Kentucky for Kentucky" atttraction and gift shop in a Lexington shopping center. Wallace and Halley have no interest whatsoever in the bear's authority under Kentucky law to solemnize marriages.</p>
