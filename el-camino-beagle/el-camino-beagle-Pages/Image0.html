  <br><br><b>Mission San Juan Bautista</b>
  <br><br>Bells placed every mile or two along Route 101 mark El Camino Real, the route along which the Spanish built a chain of missions from San Diego to San Francisco. An hour south of San Jose, we stopped at Mission San Juan Bautista. Huxley wondered where the tower was that Kim Novak jumped off of in &quot;Vertigo&quot;. He's still young; we didn't want to spoil it for him, so we didn't tell him that the tower was faked for the movie.
