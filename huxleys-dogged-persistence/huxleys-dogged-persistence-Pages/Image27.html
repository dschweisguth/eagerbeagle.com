  <br><br><b>Return to Limn</b>
  <br><br>When we worked in this neighborhood a couple of years ago Limn's signboard was a huge heart that seemed to be made of lead. Just below the bottom of the photo is a circular hole that must have been punched into the sidewalk when the old heart fell. After a couple of months with nothing but miscellaneous furniture hanging from their name, Limn have finally installed a new, lighter heart.
