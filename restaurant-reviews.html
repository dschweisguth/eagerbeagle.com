    <p>Huxley loves nothing better than eating out with his pack. His
      humans like almost every restaurant and bar on this list, but the
      ratings are Hux's, according to how comfortable he is and whether,
      if he's lucky, he gets a nibble too. Huxley's taste in wine is no
      less reliable for being based entirely on chewing the wine-soaked
      end off the cork.<br>

            any place you can walk your dog to is better than a place
            where you can't. Huxley doesn't remember whether there was a
            water bowl at this specific address, but Cortland Avenue is
            a parade of water bowls (and of dogs).<br>

            fries is of little interest to dogs, and there is less shade

            is nothing outside but a few tables on a slanty sidewalk. At

            like a Parisian tourist, or in back under the heat lamp.

            the smell of the creative and flavorful pastries, he never
            gets more than a few crumbs that fall off the crumbly ones.
            But this place opens at 7 AM like a proper bakery should,
            convenient during a morning dog walk, and it's next to
            Mission Pet Hospital, and it's on Huxley's walk to work, so

            shouldn't be allowed), and finally in the back patio, where
            he got a dog donut to celebrate. And then the boys got a

            make up for the chill wind blowing down 18th Street and the

            staff offers water, and Huxley knows nowhere else where he

            Hood River). Huxley and Wallace breakfasted at the sidewalk
            tables at the hotel's restaurant (currently Swedish, which
            seems to mean happy humans but nothing for dogs) several
            times during each of their visits. But mentioning the
            restaurant is also an excuse to sneak a mention of the
            extra-dog-friendly Hotel into this page of restaurant
            reviews. In return for a very reasonable pet fee, the Hotel
            provides a dog bowl, a protective sheet for the bed, a bag
            of treats (our brand!), a squeaky toy to kill and a welcome
            on a bone-shaped chalkboard at the reception.<br>

            River's finest white-tablecloth restaurant. There were a few
            outside tables where they could join the humans, there was a
            good list of local corks, and the staff brought water to
            pair with the bones. Unfortunately Nora's became Kin, which
            does not have a license for dogs on its patio.<br>

            go. On tap means no corks for Huxley, but at least the boys
            could relax inside while the humans refreshed themselves.
            Huxley, who likes sled dogs, was also sorry to miss out on
            Springhouse's resident malamute, said to be unfriendly to
            visiting dogs and kept in the back while we visited. We bet
            they'd have gotten along fine. Conveniently located steps

    <p>Of course Huxley is reviewing for dogs, not for humans, so some
      ratings might not be what a human would expect. Reviews of some
      establishments, mainly those outside of San Francisco, are based
      on less visits than a real reviewer would make. There are a lot of
      places off Huxley's regular routes, in and out of S.F., that he
      hasn't even been to yet; if your favorite isn't listed, maybe
      that's why. Hey, for a dog who can't drive, Hux is doing pretty
      well.<br>
