  <h1>Breakfast in the broom closet</h1>
  <p>After an evening brewpub crawl in Bend we stayed at the McMenamins Old St. Francis School hotel, which among other remarkable features has a breakfast room hidden (behind a secret door which is open in this photo) in this rather nice broom closet.<br/>
<br/>
The boys were not allowed in, and would not have enjoyed anyway, the hotel's most outstanding feature: a large soaking pool lined with beautiful art tile including four murals of St. Francis and animals.</p>
