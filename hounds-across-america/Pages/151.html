  <h1>Yoder's Restaurant and Buffet</h1>
  <p>We made a day trip from Swiftwater to Lancaster County. This buffet restaurant had as many Amish as English customers, and local specialties including ham balls, corn fritters and shoo-fly pie. It was so delicious that Wallace can tell from outside.</p>
