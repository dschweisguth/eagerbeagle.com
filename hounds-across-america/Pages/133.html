  <h1>Parker's Barbecue</h1>
  <p>This very unpretentious place was packed though it was ony Wednesday lunch. We got takeout at the mobbed counter around back and ate at a picnic table. The little $5 whole-hog pulled pork sandwich I had is my new benchmark for that style. Their mustard slaw was great, too.</p>
